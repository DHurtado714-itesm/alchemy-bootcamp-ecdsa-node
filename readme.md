# 🔐 Secure Wallet Transfer App

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my awesome project that demonstrates secure cryptocurrency transfers using ECDSA signatures. I built this to explore how we can make digital transactions more secure, even with a centralized server setup.

The coolest part? 🌟 I implemented Public Key Cryptography using Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures to ensure that only the rightful owner of an address can make transfers. Pretty neat, right?

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 💻 Client Setup

I built the frontend using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Here's how to run it:

1. 📂 Navigate to the `/client` folder in your terminal
2. 📦 Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. 🏃‍♂️ Start the app with `pnpm run dev`
4. 🌐 Visit http://127.0.0.1:5173/ in your browser

### 🖥️ Server Setup

The backend is powered by [Express](https://expressjs.com/). Follow these steps:

1. 📂 Open terminal in `/server` folder
2. 📦 Run `pnpm install` for dependencies
3. 🚀 Start server with `node index`

✨ The app will automatically connect to port 3042!

💡 Pro tip: Use [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) instead of `node` for auto-restart on code changes!
